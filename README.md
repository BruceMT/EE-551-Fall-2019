COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course presents fundamentals of Python programming language for data intensive applications and decision making. The course formally introduces industry level tools for the best practices of software engineering using Python. Such tools find applicability in many engineering application areas, including data science, machine learning, communications systems, embedded systems, smart grids, robotics, Internet, and enterprise  networks, or any network where information flows and alters decision making.

STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to…
•	program basic algorithms in Python,
•	extract and analyze data in Python,
•	prepare for their future career in Technology related fields.

FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
•	The classes will include dynamic illustrations of the concepts. Students are expected to bring their laptops and run the programs in their own laptops.
•	There will be weekly coding or handwritten assignments. The students will return coding assignments via github which will be tested using continuous integration tool Travis-CI.
