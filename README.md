## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course presents fundamentals of Python programming language for data intensive applications and decision making. The course formally introduces industry level tools for the best practices of software engineering using Python. Such tools find applicability in many engineering application areas, including data science, machine learning, communications systems, embedded systems, smart grids, robotics, Internet, and enterprise  networks, or any network where information flows and alters decision making.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES
After successful completion of this course, students will be able toâ€¦
*	program basic algorithms in Python,
*	extract and analyze data in Python,
*	prepare for their future career in Technology related fields.

## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
*	The classes will include dynamic illustrations of the concepts. Students are expected to bring their laptops and run the programs in their own laptops.
*	There will be weekly coding or handwritten assignments. The students will return coding assignments via github which will be tested using continuous integration tool Travis-CI.

## COURSE MATERIALS
* Textbook(s): 		Learning Python (5E) by Mark Lutz
* Other Readings: 	How to think like a Computer Scientist by Downey, Elkner, Meyers
* Materials:	 	Canvas will be used for sharing assignment links and grades

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS
* **Attendance**	Attendance is crucial for an effective learning but will not be graded. 
* **Homework** 	Coding assignments will be submitted via github and graded and tested in the cloud. Handwritten assignments will be returned at the beginning of a class.
* **Project**	Students are expected to finish a project that is documented in their github repository. 
* **Exams** 	There will be a single final hand-written exam.

## GRADING PROCEDURES
Grades will be based on:
* Assignments 		                    (30 %)
* Project		                          (40 %)
* Final Exam		                      (30 %)
